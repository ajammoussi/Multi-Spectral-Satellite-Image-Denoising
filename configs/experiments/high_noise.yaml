# High Noise Experiment Configuration
# Extends base.yaml with severe corruption

# Inherits from: ../base.yaml
# Challenging restoration scenario

noise:
  gaussian_sigma: 0.035  # High thermal noise
  speckle_sigma: 0.015   # High coherent noise
  dead_band_prob: 0.15   # 15% dead bands
  thermal_noise_scale: 0.01  # High thermal variation

training:
  epochs: 150  # Needs more training
  optimizer:
    lr: 5e-5  # Lower learning rate for stability
  
  loss:
    mse_weight: 1.0
    ssim_weight: 0.15  # Emphasize structure more
    
checkpoint:
  metric: "val_loss"  # Focus on overall loss reduction
